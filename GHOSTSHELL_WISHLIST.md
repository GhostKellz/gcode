# GCODE Enhancement Plan for Ghostshell

## Overview
This document outlines the text shaping and advanced Unicode features that should be added to the `gcode` library to eliminate C dependencies (particularly harfbuzz) from Ghostshell while providing superior terminal-optimized text processing.

## Core Text Shaping Features Needed

### 1. Basic Text Shaping Engine
**Priority: Critical**
- **Glyph positioning and advancement**
  - Horizontal and vertical metrics calculation
  - Kerning pair support for improved readability
  - Baseline adjustment for mixed scripts
- **Simple ligature support**
  - Common programming ligatures (→, ≠, >=, etc.)
  - Terminal-friendly ligature rendering
  - Optional ligature disable per context
- **Character substitution**
  - OpenType feature simulation for terminals
  - Context-sensitive character forms

### 2. Advanced Unicode Terminal Support
**Priority: High**
- **Bidirectional text handling (BiDi)**
  - RTL/LTR text flow for Arabic, Hebrew
  - Mixed-direction line handling
  - Terminal cursor positioning in BiDi text
- **Complex script support**
  - Arabic script joining and contextual forms
  - Indic script basic shaping (Devanagari, Tamil, etc.)
  - Thai/Lao line breaking and positioning
- **Emoji and symbol processing**
  - Multi-codepoint emoji sequence handling
  - Emoji presentation vs text presentation
  - Color emoji metadata (for future terminal support)

### 3. Terminal-Specific Optimizations
**Priority: High**
- **Monospace enforcement**
  - Character width normalization
  - Double-width character handling (CJK)
  - Zero-width character positioning
- **Line breaking intelligence**
  - Word boundary detection for terminal wrapping
  - Hyphenation hints for long words
  - Preserve formatting in terminal contexts
- **Performance optimizations**
  - Glyph cache for repeated characters
  - Fast path for ASCII-only text
  - Incremental shaping for live editing

## Technical Requirements

### API Design
```zig
// Core shaping interface
pub const TextShaper = struct {
    pub fn shape(text: []const u8, font_metrics: FontMetrics) ![]Glyph;
    pub fn measureText(text: []const u8, font_metrics: FontMetrics) TextMetrics;
    pub fn findBreakPoints(text: []const u8, max_width: f32) []BreakPoint;
};

// Terminal-optimized features
pub const TerminalShaper = struct {
    pub fn enforceMonospace(glyphs: []Glyph, cell_width: f32) void;
    pub fn calculateCursorPosition(text: []const u8, byte_offset: usize) CursorPos;
    pub fn handleBidiCursor(text: []const u8, visual_x: f32) LogicalPosition;
};
```

### Performance Targets
- **Shaping speed:** < 50ns per character for Latin text
- **Memory usage:** < 1MB for shaping cache
- **Binary size impact:** < 200KB for full shaping support
- **Cache hit rate:** > 95% for common terminal text

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Basic Latin script shaping
- Simple kerning support
- Monospace enforcement
- Integration with existing gcode Unicode processing

### Phase 2: Complex Scripts (3-4 weeks)
- Arabic script joining
- Basic Indic script support
- BiDi text handling
- RTL cursor movement

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- Programming ligatures
- Advanced emoji handling
- Performance optimizations
- Terminal-specific enhancements

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (1-2 weeks)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Benchmark optimization
- Documentation and examples
- Integration testing with Ghostshell

## Benefits for Ghostshell

### Immediate Impact
- **Eliminate harfbuzz dependency** - Reduce build complexity and binary size
- **Terminal-optimized rendering** - Better text quality than general-purpose shaping
- **Faster startup** - No external library initialization overhead
- **Cross-platform consistency** - Same behavior across all target platforms

### Long-term Advantages
- **Future-proof architecture** - Control over text rendering pipeline
- **Performance scalability** - Optimizations specific to terminal use cases
- **Extended capabilities** - Features impossible with general-purpose libraries
- **Reduced attack surface** - Fewer external dependencies

## Integration Points

### Current Ghostshell Usage
- Replace harfbuzz calls in text rendering pipeline
- Integrate with existing font loading system
- Connect to terminal cell measurement logic
- Support for theme-specific typography settings

### Future Enhancements
- Color emoji support for modern terminals
- Variable font support for better readability
- Advanced typography modes (reading, coding, presentation)
- Real-time text analysis for syntax highlighting optimization

## Risk Mitigation

### Compatibility Concerns
- Maintain fallback to simple character-by-character rendering
- Gradual migration path from harfbuzz
- Extensive testing with international text samples
- Performance monitoring and optimization tools

### Development Risks
- Start with well-tested algorithms from existing libraries
- Incremental feature addition with thorough testing
- Community feedback integration for script-specific improvements
- Benchmark against harfbuzz for quality assurance
